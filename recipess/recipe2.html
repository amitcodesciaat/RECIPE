        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>  2 ½ cups (300g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
            <li>1 cup warm water (about 110°F/45°C) </li>
            <li> 1 packet (2 ¼ teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> In a small bowl, mix the warm water with the sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li> In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until the dough starts to come together.</li>
            <li> Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li> Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size</li>
            <li> Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it heats up.</li>
